# README

This project is a full-featured blog application with a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for articles and comments. It also includes a user authentication system with login, registration, and password management. This application was developed through the GoRails Ruby on Rails for Beginners Tutorial. I used Ruby on Rails to build the backend and integrated Bootstrap for styling the forms and the main blog page.

Overview :

I developed this application to provide a platform where users can create, edit, and comment on blog articles. Additionally, I implemented a robust user authentication system that allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their accounts.

Key Features include :

- User Registration and Login : Implemented a secure sign-up process where users can create an account with an email and password. The login feature ensures that only registered users can access their personal pages.
- Password Management : Created a password reset functionality using Session-cookies-based authentication, enabling users to securely reset their passwords via email.
- Profile Editing : Users can edit their profile information, including email and password, through an easy-to-use profile management interface.
- CRUD for Articles and Comments : The application supports full CRUD functionality for articles and comments, allowing users to contribute and interact with content.
- Bootstrap Styling : Applied Bootstrap styles to all forms and the main blog page, ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly.

Technologies Used :

- Ruby on Rails : The core framework for building the blog application, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
- Bootstrap : For responsive front-end design, ensuring the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Mailer : Used for sending email notifications, particularly for password resets.
- SQLite : Used as the database for this project.

Outcome :

This project helped me enhance my understanding of web application security, authentication mechanisms, and the Ruby on Rails framework. It served as an important learning experience in building secure, user-friendly applications with real-time data management. Through this project, I gained practical experience in implementing user authentication, managing user data, and designing responsive web applications.
